            <p class="biography__p">Roger Federer was among his country's top junior tennis players by age 11. He turned
                pro in 1998, and with his victory at Wimbledon in 2003 he became the first Swiss man to win a Grand Slam
                singles title. Federer has won a record-setting 20 Grand Slam singles championships. In July 2017, the
                tennis star won a record-breaking eighth Wimbledon title, at the age of 35. </p>
            <p class="biography__p">Tennis star Roger Federer was born on August 8, 1981, in Basel, Switzerland, to
                Swiss father Robert Federer and South African mother Lynette Du Rand. Federer's parents met while on a
                business trip for a pharmaceutical company, where they both worked.
                Federer took an interest in sports at an early age, playing tennis and soccer at the age of eight. By
                age 11, he was among the Top 3 junior tennis players in Switzerland. At age 12, he decided to quit other
                sports and focus all his efforts on tennis, which he felt he excelled at more naturally. By 14, he was
                fully immersed in the game, playing two or three tournaments per month and practicing six hours a week,
                along with up to three hours of conditioning. To perfect his technique, he often imitated his idols,
                Boris Becker and Stefan Edberg.</p>
            <p class="biography__p">Federer won the Wimbledon boys' singles and doubles titles in 1998, and turned
                professional later that year. At Wimbledon in 2001, he caused a sensation by knocking out reigning
                singles champion Pete Sampras in the fourth round. In 2003, following a successful season on grass,
                Federer became the first Swiss man to win a Grand Slam title when he emerged victorious at Wimbledon.
                At the beginning of 2004, Federer had a world ranking of No. 2, and that same year, he won the
                Australian Open, the U.S. Open, the ATP Masters and retained the Wimbledon singles title. He was ranked
                No. 1 at the start of 2005, and his successes that year included the Wimbledon singles title (for a
                third successive year) and the U.S. Open.</p>
